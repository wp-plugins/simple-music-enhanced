== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I play other formats instead of MP3s? =
No, currently we do not offer other functionalities. (We might, in the future) However, the fastest quick fix around that is to convert your music format from wma, wav, etc to MP3. (You can see many types of converters here: http://www.google.com/search?num=100&hl=en&safe=off&site=&source=hp&q=mp3+converter )

= How Do I Upload My Own Songs? =
Wordpress has an in-built upload feature! Login to your admin panel, then go to Media > Add New on the sidebar and upload your MP3. 

= Can I Add More Than One Song? =
As of now, no. We are currently working on implementing a full playlist.
